    // Multiple inheritance is not supported by Java
    // as a child class may extend to more than one class and different class may have same variable i.e.
    // accessing that variable it doesn't know which one has to be accessed as both have same reference variable
    // Therefore Java doesn't support "Multiple Inheritance".

    // NOTE:- In Java, we can achieve multiple inheritances only through Interfaces.
